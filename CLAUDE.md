Wedding-planning checklist for couples. Spanish-first. Next.js (App Router) + Supabase.

## Authoritative documents (they win over implementation convenience)

- `docs/product/PRODUCT-CONSTITUTION.md`
- `docs/architecture/ADR-001-product-domain-and-tenancy.md`
- `docs/architecture/ADR-002-auth-and-security-boundaries.md`
- `docs/architecture/ADR-003-donor-extraction-policy.md`

## Product rules

- Couple-first, Wedding-first, checklist-first. The list is home.
- Spanish-first: UI copy lives in `src/lib/i18n/messages/es.ts`, never inline. Code and docs are in English.
- Wedding language, not PM language: no project/program/portfolio/stakeholder/workstream/task concepts.
- No AOC, Frontera, governance machinery or AI authority.
- Donor code (Wedding-Fran-Marilu, PMFreak) is never copied; study, then reimplement (ADR-003).

## Engineering rules

- Strict TypeScript. No `@ts-ignore`, no `any` to silence errors.
- RLS enabled in the same migration that creates any table.
- The service-role key is never normal persistence. There is no service-role client;
  adding one needs a dedicated `server-only` module plus a written justification (ADR-002 §6).
  ESLint blocks `process.env.SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` by default.
- Browser code reads env only through `src/lib/env/public.ts` (`NEXT_PUBLIC_*` only).
- Modules that touch cookies or secrets start with `import "server-only"`.
- Migrations live in `supabase/migrations/`, named `YYYYMMDDHHMMSS_lb_<slug>.sql`; applied
  migrations are immutable. No hand-run or direct production schema changes. No remote `supabase link`/`db push` without explicit approval.
- No hidden auth shortcuts: authority comes from server-side membership checks, never client input or `user_metadata`.
- Tests validate behavior, not source text.

## Commands

- `npm run verify`: lint, typecheck, unit tests, build (same as CI)
- `npm run test:e2e`: Playwright smoke test against a production build (needs `npx playwright install chromium`)

## Prompt sequencing

Work is delivered in numbered prompts (LB-NN). LB-02 is foundation only: no domain schema, auth flows or
features. Later prompts own the domain: LB-03 is the first product data foundation. Don't implement ahead of the current prompt.
